### Hi!

Welcome to my profile.

Feel free to check out my [website](https://nekevss.github.io). :smile:

I'm probably working on some portion of the Temporal built-in.

Programming languages: Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, VBA, (some Python)

:fire: Hottest dumb take: VBA (with Excel) is incredibly useful in a corporate setting and slept on.
