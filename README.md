## Hi there! Welcome to my profile.

Feel free to check out my [website](https://nekevss.github.io). :smile:

I'm probably working on some portion of the Temporal built-in.

### What am I working on?

#### Boa

Boa's an experimental JavaScript engine being written in Rust. I think it's really cool and super fun to work on. Feel free to check it out [here](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa).

#### Product Content Desktop App

This project is a tool I develop and maintain for work. It's essentially a staging area/mini 
CMS for Staples operations team that was designed to streamline our content process. As of 
2024-04-19, it's been generally adopted by the ops team and strategy, and has been used to
quality assure and process content on nearly all products published to any BU for the past
4 years. Oh, it can also generate content based off an internal style guide. So that was
handy and fun to implement! :smile:

It's also **serverless**! Some compute for more functionality was requested but not receieved, so
it has no server.

### Programming languages

Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, VBA, Python

### :fire: Hottest dumb take

VBA (with Excel) is incredibly useful in a corporate setting and slept on. If you create a tool with a GUI,
you have to create documentation and train people. If you hand someone and Excel sheet with a button, they
can automatically use the tool. Perfect for free, quick, one-off CLI tools!

#### Also known as

Please for the love of all that is good, don't use VBA and Excel for your company's actual product.
